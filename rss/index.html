Not sure what got into us this weekend but we decided to stay in the fanciest hotel we could find in Chiang Rai, which was totally unnecessary.  Maybe it was that Valentine's Day love flowing through the air, or the excitement of our first weekend get-a-way since being in Thailand.  Or maybe we were just overly excited to find a 5 star hotel, balcony suite for $140/night, including a stupendous breakfast buffet.  Where we're from, the prices for a room at a resort like this would have been around $500-$600/night.  So we went for it, and it was fantastic! The hotel that I speak of is called, <a href="https://www.theriverie.com/">The Riverie by Katathani.</a>  It overlooks the Mae Kok River and offers a great view of what's known as the Big Buddha which sits on the hilltop above Chiang Rai.  We had a balcony suite overlooking the river and hotel pool.  Quinn was super excited because the pool had a small play area with a waterslide.  Jamie and I were super excited because the pool had a pool bar!  If you're in Chiang Rai and are looking for something boujee, The Riverie is a great place to stay.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://wagabonds.family/content/images/2020/03/Qv-eMKxUSkaHoiOYGv8U8g_thumb_47b9.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Chiang Rai in a long-tail boat nutshell"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://wagabonds.family/content/images/2020/03/76NKZwxgQnOrqATjou6ACw_thumb_478d.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Chiang Rai in a long-tail boat nutshell"><figcaption>Amazing breakfast buffet</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>Now, for all of the wild things we got up to in Chiang Rai!</p><p><strong>The Chiang Rai Balloon Fiesta:</strong></p><p>Thailand loves a good festival and this one was no exception. The Balloon Fiesta is an annual event in Chiang Rai and it's a pretty big deal.  It's a 5 day festival of hot-air balloon madness.  Balloon pilots from all over the world come to participate in competitions and festivities. We were lucky enough to catch the last night of the festivities.  We felt like we had stumbled into the Thai Coachella.  Hot-air balloons, lasers, musical performances of all kinds, beer gardens, food stall heaven and loads of great merchandise for purchase.  This place was like night market meets rave.</p><p>The drive was nearly 40 minutes from our hotel to the Singha Park where the festival was being held.  Followed by a 30 minute trek from where our Grab driver (Thailand's version of Uber) had to drop us off due to the amount of traffic.  This was definitely not the easiest place to get to, but definitely worth the journey. It's said that tourists come from all over for this event but we didn't feel that way at all.  We actually loved the true local feel that this festival had.  The majority of the crowd appeared to us to be Thai locals.  It sort of felt like the whole town of Chiang Rai was in attendance.  Our suspicions regarding this were validated the next day when 3 separate employees working at our hotel informed us that they had spotted us at the Balloon Fiesta the night before.</p><p>If you are visiting Chiang Rai in February, this festival must not be missed!</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://wagabonds.family/content/images/2020/03/ETGWjtP-TTuP3puVlqdmeA_thumb_487f.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Chiang Rai in a long-tail boat nutshell"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://wagabonds.family/content/images/2020/03/AJJAkkiRTJ6SX1Y3dL09cg_thumb_48b7.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Chiang Rai in a long-tail boat nutshell"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>On our Grab ride home from the festival we met Noom. Noom was so great and offered to be our driver the following day for our visits to the temples.  Noom picked us up at 9:30 a.m. and chauffeured us around all day.  The perk to having Noom as our driver was that he spoke English relatively well and was very enthusiastic about teaching us Thai. So we basically got a tour guide and language teacher all in one!  I've managed to retain one phrase from our day's worth of lessons.  That phrase is <em>sawadi ton chaw</em>, which means good morning.  I've been told by some locals that my accent is very good when pronouncing this, and I owe that all to Noom!</p><p><strong>Wat Rong Khun (White Temple)</strong></p><p>Going to Chiang Rai and not visiting the White Temple is like going to New York City and not visiting the Statue of Liberty. It has to be done!  This was the first place Noom took us. What a trip this temple is!  As expected it's brimming with tourists in search of the best selfie they could take in very calculated poses.  The next best thing to seeing the White Temple is watching all the tourist take selfies, it's pretty entertaining. All jokes aside, there are tons of great photos to be taken here.</p><p>It's definitely like no other temple we've seen.  It's described as an art exhibit in the style of a Buddhist temple and that's because it's designed completely by a local artist from Chiang Rai.  Chalermchai Kositpipat decided to restore the formerly dilapidated temple funding the project with all of his own money.  Talk about a labor of love!  It feels like a mix between a Buddhist temple and a museum of pop-culture.  It's offbeat, innovative, ingenious, kitschy, breathtaking, and just a wee-bit terrifying. The details of the temple and everything that surround it are INSANE!</p><p>My favorite part was the silver heart-shaped wish leaves hanging from the ceilings of walkways and prayer trees.  You can purchase these leaves for 30 baht ($1 US), write wishes or messages on the leaves and hang them on the prayer trees. Quinn really wanted to write all of our names on our wish leaf.  The leaves are eventually relocated to a permanent spot making them a fixture for life at the White Temple.  The glimmer of these leaves hanging all around is dazzling!</p><p>Guys...you gotta go to the White Temple sometime in your life!</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://wagabonds.family/content/images/2020/03/umRuTMZ3QiiG01hec5imsA_thumb_4832.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Chiang Rai in a long-tail boat nutshell"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://wagabonds.family/content/images/2020/03/HKp512LsRfG6FoSCqKOPcg_thumb_489c.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Chiang Rai in a long-tail boat nutshell"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://wagabonds.family/content/images/2020/03/trCbCgj1QyKrJ1avzwGpig_thumb_4884.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Chiang Rai in a long-tail boat nutshell"><figcaption>Hanging planters in the shape of superheroes and villains alike</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://wagabonds.family/content/images/2020/03/uAJ-mtOdQi2ld0rLG6rhNA_thumb_47cf.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Chiang Rai in a long-tail boat nutshell"><figcaption>Wish-leaves</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://wagabonds.family/content/images/2020/03/sOKQqgUBQBm1hgBXw0xwxw_thumb_47cc.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Chiang Rai in a long-tail boat nutshell"><figcaption>Quinn writing on our wish leaf.

Which later I found out is not really Buddha at all, but instead the goddess of Mercy, known as Bodhisattva.  Makes sense its called Big Buddha, it is a lot easier to say than Bodhisattva.  A Bodhisattva in the Buddist faith, is one who has reached enlightenment.</p><p>This Bodhisattva stands 23 stories tall. You can take an elevator up to the top of her if you so choose.  The 23rd floor is a tiny circular landing point.  Not as tiny as the bus bathroom but preeeety small.  There are ornate carving on the walls and gorgeous statues everywhere but the real gift is the view.  That's if you are into views out of the slits of Bodhisattva's eyes which have no barriers or screens attached to them.  Im not!  It was all I could do to get myself to shove my selfie stick out one small window in the back which did have safety bars over it.  I got a brief video before racing back to the elevator to get out of there.  The space is small, there's lots of people up there, and I am not the biggest fan of heights, but hey...I'm one step close to enlightenment after that experience.  The boys loved it!  </p><p>There's also a pretty sweet pagoda, called Long Son Pagoda to check out next to Big Buddha.  And to top it all off, there are two small food stalls that serve free lunch....you heard me FREE!</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://wagabonds.family/content/images/2020/03/rUjYfuuxRqmkpZ1jUr3SNw_thumb_4840.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Chiang Rai in a long-tail boat nutshell"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://wagabonds.family/content/images/2020/03/f4lW31VCTlaft1j1tpBwmQ_thumb_4842.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Chiang Rai in a long-tail boat nutshell"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://wagabonds.family/content/images/2020/03/Hwdu42y-TGeVSrLTF-1bnA_thumb_482c-1.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Chiang Rai in a long-tail boat nutshell"><figcaption>The eye-slits of Bodhisattva with ZERO safety features.</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://wagabonds.family/content/images/2020/03/Ojux94oRSDG5jBZ7Ta05rQ_thumb_483f.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Chiang Rai in a long-tail boat nutshell"><figcaption>Long Son Pagoda</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p><strong>Long-Tail Boat Along the Mae-Kok River:</strong></p><p>Now for our favorite part of the weekend, a simple ride down the Mae Kok River in a long-tail boat.  Nothing screams, "Im in fucking South East Asia" like riding in a long-tail boat.  These are canoe shaped boats with canopies. The 'tail' is actually the front of the boat which stretches out into a long, elegant point.  They are used primarily to transport people down rivers.  They are iconic in Thailand and they are chic.</p><p>Our hotel offered boat rides to visit the elephant camps or to go visit one of the hill tribes.  After weeks of research, we already had our elephant situation figured out so we weren't interested in a visit this weekend.  As far as visiting the hill tribes,  initially we were really keen on going to visit one of the northern Thailand tribes. The Karen tribe who are best recognized as wearing the gold rings stretched around their necks were at the peak of our interest.  Upon looking into where and how to visit these tribes, I read about them being exploited by the tour operators due to the growing popularity among visitors.  Some say that very little money from the tours go back to the villages who really need it. The term "human zoo" is thrown around to illustrate how these people are trapped in their villages and exploited for purposes of tourism.  </p><p>Look, there is a lot of debate over this.  Most certainly some of these hill tribes are also benefiting from the money of tourist buying their merchandise or staying in home-stays in their villages.  Article after article will tell you to do your research to find the best way to visit these tribes and most definitely there is an ethical way to do so.  At the end of the day, I just didn't want to do any more research.  The way I see it, sometimes when you have to spend hours researching the ethicality of something it's easier to just strike it off of your list.</p><p>Instead, we opted for a simple ride up and down the Mae Kok River at sunset.  The evening was picturesque as the sun set over the mountain tops.  Many families were out enjoying the sunset hour with dinner on the river.  Kids were playing and men were fishing.  The excitement of everyone we passed along the way was infectious and we found ourselves exuberantly waiving back and yelling hi!  It was peaceful, the sky was golden, it was a perfect night.  And then, Jamie had to pee.  He used sign-language to explain to the driver of our boat that he had to pee.  Meanwhile, I'm laughing, thinking he's shit out of luck.  And then, our driver (who spoke zero English prior) pulls the boat over to the hillside and says, "Thailand toilet" with a laugh!  Off Jamie went to go piss in the most scenic Thailand toilet he has ever used, on the hillside of the Mae Kok River.  We all had a good laugh over this.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://wagabonds.family/content/images/2020/03/EzM6Y9oyR3Ge7BzgJ2aBeg_thumb_4a34.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Chiang Rai in a long-tail boat nutshell"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://wagabonds.family/content/images/2020/03/cuNczC2ITCCCqtzjUm50Cw_thumb_47e6.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Chiang Rai in a long-tail boat nutshell"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://wagabonds.family/content/images/2020/03/whgizSU6Qdal-TBo0T9jaw_thumb_47fe.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Chiang Rai in a long-tail boat nutshell"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p><strong>Wat Rong Suea Ten (Blue Temple)</strong></p><p>Last but not least, the Blue Temple.  You've seen one temple, you've seen them all right?  Nope...not until you've seen the Blue Temple.  The blue-ness of this place is gripping.  I won't bore you with any facts about the Blue Temple (honestly, I don't really know any).  The photos speak for themselves.  Let's just put it this way, even the monks were taking photos!</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://wagabonds.family/content/images/2020/03/dQGohFnDQiWM3qKZoi7oxw_thumb_485b.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Chiang Rai in a long-tail boat nutshell"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://wagabonds.family/content/images/2020/03/zUfFD554ReucY4GcJHZEEg_thumb_47fa.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Chiang Rai in a long-tail boat nutshell"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://wagabonds.family/content/images/2020/03/gr-7PYnLTJmFLa-pMOgRmg_thumb_47ed.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Chiang Rai in a long-tail boat nutshell"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://wagabonds.family/content/images/2020/03/wqyH08SJR6aPJ1YgKbJSzQ_thumb_485f.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Chiang Rai in a long-tail boat nutshell"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://wagabonds.family/content/images/2020/03/lFugFYZjRTq7ByuNCwOQaA_thumb_4852.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Chiang Rai in a long-tail boat nutshell"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>And that folks, concludes one fantastic weekend trip to Chiang Rai, Thailand.  We came, we raved, we templed, we boated (in a long-tail boat!), we had ourselves a couple of memorable pees, one on a bus and one on a river bank.  What more could you ask for in a weekend?</p><p>Big thanks to those of you who continue to read our blog.</p><!--kg-card-begin: embed--><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><blockquote class="instagram-media" data-instgrm-captioned="" data-instgrm-permalink="https://www.instagram.com/tv/B9S3laBFITc/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading" data-instgrm-version="12" style=" background:#FFF;

Our first stop was an outdoor market which has been around for more than 100 years.  Sammy has been coming to this market since he was a kid.  You could tell that this was a real locals market as we were the only tourists to be seen.  Sammy walked us through the market and educated us on the likes of Thai chilies, the best brand of coconut milk, and the difference between sticky rice and jasmine rice.  It was very educational.  </p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://wagabonds.family/content/images/2020/02/IMG_6828.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt="Sammy's Organic Thai Cooking School: Chiang Mai, Thailand"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://wagabonds.family/content/images/2020/02/IMG_6827.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt="Sammy's Organic Thai Cooking School: Chiang Mai, Thailand"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>We instantly loved Sammy.  He is adorable and absolutely hilarious, finding every opportunity to slip in a subtle joke where he could.  He's smiley and has a real infectious and playful personality which kept us laughing all day long. </p><p>After the market we headed to Sammy's farm.  The farm is nestled within acres of rice paddies and surrounded by lush green hills.  The main cooking area is an open-air kitchen equipped with several stations of individual burners.  Next to the cooking stations is a long-wooden table.  At each place setting was a small round cutting board, pestle and mortar, an apron and a hand cloth.  </p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://wagabonds.family/content/images/2020/02/IMG_6834.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt="Sammy's Organic Thai Cooking School: Chiang Mai, Thailand"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://wagabonds.family/content/images/2020/02/IMG_6833.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt="Sammy's Organic Thai Cooking School: Chiang Mai, Thailand"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>We spent the first 30 minutes having coffee and exploring the grounds.  The kitchen area is surrounded by several bamboo decks furnished with floor cushions and hammocks.  The decks over-look fish ponds surrounded by coconut palm trees.  There are a couple bridges which span the length of the ponds and the property is filled with pots brimming with fresh herbs, plants, fruit trees and vegetables.  Sammy is super proud his farm, as he should be, this place is paradise!

 We were given a list of Thai classics to choose from.  <strong>Curry:</strong> Red (also called jungle curry), yellow or green with chicken.  <strong>Soup:</strong> Hot and sour prawn soup, coconut chicken soup or Thai vegetable hot soup.  <strong>Stir Fried:</strong> Minced chicken with holy basil, chicken with cashew nut or the classic Pad Thai noodle with chicken.  For a vegetarian option, tofu or vegetables could be substituted for chicken in any of the dishes.

(Have you seen the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvIRh-qt9EQ">Pace Picante commercial</a> where the cowboys call out their friend for showing up with an imposter salsa?  Upon finding out it was made in NYC and not San Antonio, they all scream in unison, "New York City??!!"  These were the voices I heard in my head as we walked through the entrance of this hotel with our iMac and abundance of luggage). I walked in and was immediately smashed in the face by the overwhelming smell of cigarette smoke, like casino level cigarette smoke!  "Alright", (not so optimistically trying to be optimistic at this point), "certainly the rooms can't be this bad".  A fact I never confirmed to be true since we never made it up to our room.  </p><p>This hotel had one very charming, extremely small (I'm being generous), historic elevator.  So charming in fact that once our luggage cart was loaded, there was no room for any of our bodies!  At this point Jamie removed the cart from the elevator and we weighed out our options.</p><p><strong>Option 1: </strong> Send the luggage up the elevator on its own and run up 5 flights of stairs in hopes to catch it right when the doors open. </p><p><strong>Option 2:</strong> Carry all of our luggage up 5 flights of stairs.  This was early on in our travels and we still had way to0 many belongings (we have since sized down considerably).  </p><p><strong>Option 3: </strong>Cancel our reservation and find another place to stay.</p><p>Option 3 was agreed upon within 15 seconds of our discussion.  I walked up to the front desk and asked if it was too late to cancel and still receive a full refund.  "Have you been to the room?", the guy asked. "No, we can't fit our luggage in the elevator" (which he was fully aware of since he had been sitting there the whole time watching our struggle). "Then yeah", he said.  Then yeah, may have been the most polite response we got out of this guy and also our signal that we could be refunded and get the hell out of there.</p><p>The next hour was a shit show of calls to Hotels.com.  They had to call the front desk of the hotel to confirm we were no longer checking in, the front desk was picking up the phone and hanging up on them.  This happened several times in a row.  How's that for a country-western middle finger?  Some other uncomfortable stuff happened during that hour, including the fine gentleman at the front desk pronouncing our last name as Fagner instead of Wagner.  I'm going to stop right there as by now you're probably getting the picture.   </p><p>We got out of that place and headed to dinner.  We found another hotel room which was pricey but ended up being fantastic. We downed 4 overpriced drinks (2 each) and went to sleep.  Shout out to <a href="https://cheyenne.littleamerica.com/">Little America Cheyenne</a> for saving our hides that night.  They had free parking too!  Also a shout out to Hotels.com for giving us a $75 voucher for our hassles.</p><p>We were up, car-packed, snacks ready and on the road by 7 a.m. the next morning heading off on our drive to Custer State Park and Mount Rushmore.  I held my breathe for much of the drive until we arrived at the sign welcoming us to Black Hills National Park. </p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://wagabonds.family/content/images/2020/01/xsFShsFjQP-RgsPlZ8yssw_thumb_30aa.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Wide open, scary spaces all the way to Mount Rushmore"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p> We made it to Custer State Park by noon and headed down Needles Highway to check out this home on the range where the buffalos roam and the deer and antelopes play.  Thanks to a travel family that we met on Instagram, I was given some valuable tips for exploring this area.</p><p><strong>Custer State Park</strong></p><p>Per the pro-tips we were given, we took Needles Highway Drive. What a sight!  The views of the spire-shaped rocks from here are phenomenal.  Next, we drove through a space about the width of our car called Needles Eye Tunnel and along the beginning of the highway.  This was my favorite part of Custer Park.  It is so beautiful through here with views of the cathedral spires at every turn.  There are tons of places to hike along this road.  We decided to do the Cathedral Spires Trail which is 1.6 miles, involves some mild rock climbing but is otherwise very kid-friendly. </p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://wagabonds.family/content/images/2020/01/8TunEHLpQxeLXNqDFYr4Cg_thumb_30b5.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Wide open, scary spaces all the way to Mount Rushmore"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://wagabonds.family/content/images/2020/01/eLWyyMUYSOeGuGZvlHMNCA_thumb_309f.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Wide open, scary spaces all the way to Mount Rushmore"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://wagabonds.family/content/images/2020/01/Ko4T-gtnT3SrUivzBM9COQ_thumb_30ad.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Wide open, scary spaces all the way to Mount Rushmore"><figcaption>Cathedral Spires Trail</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p><strong>The Wildlife Loop</strong></p><p>After our hike we continued along the highway to the visitor center.  It's here that a park ranger informed us: A buffalo is capable of crushing a small SUV in seconds but otherwise it's perfectly safe to drive by them at close range.  In spite of his encouraging words we took our chances and headed down the Wildlife Loop in hopes of seeing some buffalos charging, I mean roaming.  </p><p>There was not as much wildlife as we had hoped for on the Wildlife Loop that day. The highlight was the pack of adorable burros who came straight into our car windows looking for snacks.  We were't sure if we were supposed to feed these guys and we certainly didn't have snacks appropriate for a burro, so we refrained from offering them our road snacks.  That didn't seem to stop other tourists as we noticed one over-indulgent burro walking around with a Cheez-It on it's back.  As we continued down the road we did see a herd of buffalo off to the side of the road lying in the grass.  They weren't particularly close to the road but close enough to get a decent view of them, especially through binoculars kindly loaned to us by some other buffalo watching tourists.  We did end up seeing one lone buffalo crossing the road a little ways up and praise be, he did not charge, nor crush our car!  </p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://wagabonds.family/content/images/2020/01/FnzHnQn-R2yNwTLruq5HyA_thumb_3071.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Wide open, scary spaces all the way to Mount Rushmore"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://wagabonds.family/content/images/2020/01/2nvQ349aSp-C4b-m1E-3Rw_thumb_30d2.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Wide open, scary spaces all the way to Mount Rushmore"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://wagabonds.family/content/images/2020/01/BBg35UjuRkmXXdZRVN7wRA_thumb_30d9.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Wide open, scary spaces all the way to Mount Rushmore"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p><strong>Iron Mountain Road</strong></p><p>Next, we took Iron Mountain Road towards Keystone, the town we were staying in that evening.  What an incredible drive!  Honestly, for someone who is not a fan of driving, take my advice on this one and drive this road.  This is definitely the most amazing stretch of road that I have ever been on and a truly unforgettable experience.  Iron Mountain Road is 17 miles long and filled with curves, switchbacks, wooden bridges (called pigtail bridges) and very narrow granite tunnels.  A couple of these tunnels were built specifically so that when passing through you get a little peak of Mt. Rushmore.  Other than a lookout point at the beginning of the road these tunnels are the only glimpse you get along the way showcasing the mountain sculpture.  This road is designed to be driven very slow in order to take in the sights and smells of your surroundings. Driven slowly (the speed limit is 35 miles per hour) and making a couple stops along the way, this drive will take you about 45 minutes to complete.  If you don't do anything else in Custer State Park, do this drive.  It's magical and was the highlight of our day!</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://wagabonds.family/content/images/2020/01/5319ss1fTcOIRoZ10YaRcg_thumb_30ca.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Wide open, scary spaces all the way to Mount Rushmore"><figcaption>Look-out at the beginning of Iron Mountain Road</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://wagabonds.family/content/images/2020/01/tHH8prfHQ0eoWP2ivC8KzQ_thumb_3074.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Wide open, scary spaces all the way to Mount Rushmore"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p><strong>Keystone, South Dakota</strong></p><p>We arrived in the quaint, little town of Keystone, South Dakota around 5 p.m. that evening.  This is an old mining village which has been transformed into a small resort town catering to the thousands of tourists passing through each year to check out the monuments.  Unless you are hanging out at the Red Garter Saloon (which looks exactly like a scene out of Deadwood) this town is a bit snoozy.  There are a few somewhat overpriced restaurants along the strip but nothing too amazing. We stayed at the <a href="https://www.baymontkeystone.com/">Baymont Hotel</a> which had a bunk bed in our room. So, in Quinn's opinion this was the BEST place we have ever stayed in!  Hey, as long as he's happy, we're happy.  We were exhausted from our long day and went to bed early that night.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://wagabonds.family/content/images/2020/01/BRok8W6NQbC-d-GqPfH7GA_thumb_312a.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Wide open, scary spaces all the way to Mount Rushmore"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://wagabonds.family/content/images/2020/01/AfwemGYwTH2A9FoZH0vA2A_thumb_307f.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Wide open, scary spaces all the way to Mount Rushmore"><figcaption>Red Garter Saloon</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p><strong>Mount Rushmore</strong></p><p>The next morning we got up very early, hit up the free breakfast at our hotel and headed right over to Mt. Rushmore at 7:30 in the morning to beat the crowds.  It was slightly raining that morning but by the time we got there it had subsided and we were blessed by the most amazing view of Mt. Rushmore with a rainbow shooting out over the top . The monument opens up at 8 a.m. officially but you are welcome to show up anytime and I highly recommend doing so.  We spent the next hour and a half walking around the base and hiking the Presidential Trail.  This trail has about 422 steps and takes you up close and personal to the sculpture.  In all honesty, I really did not expect to enjoy this experience as much as I did.  The sculpture of the President's faces is truly magnificent and the grounds on which it resides is absolutely breathtaking.  We saw tons of chipmunks and squirrels along our hike, including a red squirrel (which from our home studies we learned are very rare in North America).  Getting there before the crowds and having the trail all to ourselves was the best decision we could have made.  This whole morning is engraved in my memory forever!  </p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://wagabonds.family/content/images/2020/01/uhZRQUnmRvK51BY70kv92Q_thumb_311a.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Wide open, scary spaces all the way to Mount Rushmore"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://wagabonds.family/content/images/2020/01/L6V8B19HT3W-9E9E6rTaeg_thumb_30fa.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Wide open, scary spaces all the way to Mount Rushmore"><figcaption>Presidential Trail</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://wagabonds.family/content/images/2020/01/sgw-lHmHR9md6rJ0Q6BlGQ_thumb_3105.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Wide open, scary spaces all the way to Mount Rushmore"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>After our hike we headed over to the Sculpture Studio which is located right at the base of the trail.  Here you can sit in on a short presentation about the sculpture and how it came to be.

We took this route on our way from Boise to Salt Lake City and it was absolutely spectacular.  The highway begins at Interstate 84 near Bliss and follows U.S. 30 southeast through Twin Falls.  The route gets its name from the thousands of springs which run through Snake River Canyon. Many springs and waterfalls are visible from the byway and there are plenty of turn-offs where you can snap great shots of some waterfalls.  On the side of the road in Bliss, where the highway begins, there is a map of the stops along the way.  The view from here isn't so bad either.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://wagabonds.family/content/images/2019/11/reUI8ZCISNG-1Nqq4UmVtA_thumb_2f72.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Chasing waterfalls to Salt Lake City"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://wagabonds.family/content/images/2019/11/Uw8FF83hTSaPzlgfV1WjPg_thumb_2f8e.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Chasing waterfalls to Salt Lake City"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p> If you find yourself on this route, I highly suggest taking a small detour to check out the Perrine Bridge and the Twin Falls Visitor Center which sits just off to the side of the bridge.  This center is a nice stop with unique Idaho treats, souvenirs, and coffee.  The Perrine Bridge stretches across the Snake River and stands at 486 ft. tall.  Because of it's height it is popular with base jumpers.  If you get lucky you will catch a few of these insane humans diving off the ledge of the bridge.  There were several jumpers the day we were there and we stood there and watched them for about 30 minutes. I was having small heart attacks as we watched each one plunge to their near death.  It was difficult enough for me to stand close to the edge of the look-out point to take a decent picture with my fear of heights.  Jumping off this bridge is inconceivable to me, but loads of fun to watch others do!</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://wagabonds.family/content/images/2019/11/CwJKtT-UQfO3TVSjBDISPA_thumb_2f6d.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Chasing waterfalls to Salt Lake City"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://wagabonds.family/content/images/2019/11/CIlSZ0l-QyqTwx9c7Q4nzA_thumb_2f81.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Chasing waterfalls to Salt Lake City"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><!--kg-card-begin: embed--><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/374570660?app_id=122963" width="240" height="426" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen title="IMG_1531"></iframe></figure><!--kg-card-end: embed--><p>From there, we headed back to highway 30 toward Shoshone Falls.  Shoshone Falls has been called the Niagara Falls of the west.  I was skeptical about this grandiose title as I have not seen any gorge greater than Niagara Falls.  But WOW, did these falls impress!  The water levels were low in mid-September when we were there but it was still magnificent.  The view of Snake River from this look-out is also incredible.  We decided that we will definitely come back here on another family vacation, rent kayaks and paddle down the Snake River.  This drive is a must if you are vacationing through southern Idaho.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://wagabonds.family/content/images/2019/11/DtO-tduYSbqPY-cd8tNh4A_thumb_2f64.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Chasing waterfalls to Salt Lake City"><figcaption>Shoshone Falls</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://wagabonds.family/content/images/2019/11/cd5mSIaoS6uKSENrLq63yQ_thumb_2f56.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Chasing waterfalls to Salt Lake City"><figcaption>View of Snake River from Shoshone Falls.

How considerate of Utah to make sure one is properly fed enough to consume alcohol responsibly.  The cashier was kind enough to allow us to order two beers after I ordered a salad along with Quinn's pizza.  </p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://wagabonds.family/content/images/2019/11/odyrD9TGSMmXSg1thTQfjg_thumb_2ff0.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Chasing waterfalls to Salt Lake City"><figcaption>Cotopaxi is Jamie's favorite bag company, headquartered in SLC.

Rather than go into a long description about the beauty of these trails, just take a look for yourself. </p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://wagabonds.family/content/images/2019/09/UDmfgqqNTemuy1UeIWCbTQ_thumb_2d7e-1.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="A Bender to Boise"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://wagabonds.family/content/images/2019/09/kW0St9FkRNWo46nUUgxoAQ_thumb_2d7d.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="A Bender to Boise"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://wagabonds.family/content/images/2019/09/1BLBe-zdTqmNN7wMXCFqvg_thumb_2d75.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="A Bender to Boise"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>After the trails we threw the paddle boards on the car and headed down to the Deschutes for Jamie and I's first ever paddle board experience.  We hit the river, stood up immediately and began paddling upstream for the next hour.  What a nice workout.  It's the best combination of a leg, core and arm workouts while still being completely relaxing.  We loved it.  </p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://wagabonds.family/content/images/2019/09/bg4eb4ihSQuNXHUcSDWvZQ_thumb_3031.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="A Bender to Boise"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>At this point we were really starting to feel like true Bend locals with a run and a paddle in the books by 2 p.m.  Morgan explained that many Bend residents will congregate in the evenings boasting about the line up of outdoor activities they had completed that day.  We pondered what we could do to make this day into a trifecta of outdoorsy events which we could brag about at our get together later that evening. We landed on the boys going to the brewery and arcade and the girls jumping in the sauna for a steam.  That's about as close to a Bend trifecta as the Wagabonds were capable of.</p><p>The rest of the night was filled with food, drinks and wonderful company, followed by a wild ride on the Matlock's golf cart equipped with off-roading wheels.  We made frequent stops to gaze at the stars in amazement.  You could literally see every single constellation and then some in the night sky.</p><p>The next morning we said our good-byes over the best damn breakfast east of the Deschutes River.  If you are in Bend, the <a href="https://themckaycottage.com/">McKay Cottage Restaurant</a> is a must.  Get whatever is on the menu, it's all fantastic.  But whatever you do, get a side of the Lemon-Ricotta pancakes for the table to share, you will not regret it (well, you might just a little when you're too full to drive to Boise right away, but get them anyways).  </p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://wagabonds.family/content/images/2019/09/rcCGV5EpR-Ws8gzE8SUV2g_thumb_2d9c.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="A Bender to Boise"><figcaption>With our cousins Morgan and Christina at McCay's Cottage</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>We came, we ran, we paddled, we brewed, we steamed, we partied, we stargazed and we stuffed our faces.  Bend, you did not disappoint.  Matlock family, thank you and we love you!</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://wagabonds.family/content/images/2019/09/foVpHzTASuGVuPeF2uLZcw_thumb_2d8e.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="A Bender to Boise"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><h2 id="boise">Boise</h2><p>Ok, if I'm being 100% honest we were a little underwhelmed with Boise when we first arrived.  It didn't help that we got here at nearly 11 p.m. after getting a late start out of Bend (no thanks to those Lemon-Ricotta pancakes) and checked into an underground basement apartment, which felt more like a bunker.  Not to mention, settling for Burger King out of pure necessity, since nothing else was open at that hour.  None of these things make for a great start.  Also, coming from a house in Portland that was arguably better than our rental back home, this was a hard transition.  I also may have been a hard sell on anywhere at this point coming from Portland since it is one of my most favorite cities.  In any case, all we needed was a good night's sleep and a reset.</p><p>We arrived the night before Labor Day and woke up Monday morning with high hopes for Boise.  My plan was to go float the river on an inner tube, but Jamie wanted to explore the city instead.  I should have been a little more pushy about floating the river because we later found out that the last day of the season to float the river is Labor Day....aaaaand we missed it (you may be sensing the tiniest bit of resentment over this mistake...but I digress).  The town of Boise was like a ghost town on Labor Day...understandably, well, because it was Labor Day and everyone was probably floating the river (my last dig, I swear).  It was actually refreshing to see so many businesses closed on the one day we are supposed to be honoring our country's laborers.  The OC and LA area rarely shut down for anything.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://wagabonds.family/content/images/2019/09/tdm0zTPMknnOhKNHxYNo4dUM0aqZH5jsokfGTS2OVo8.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="A Bender to Boise"><figcaption>Other people having fun floating on the Boise River since we didn't make it (Seriously...my final dig)</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>Fast forward, one week in, and we are feeling different about this cute, under-stated, little city.  We couldn't have chosen a better part of town to stay.  Boise's North End is a historic district filled with turn-of-the-century style homes and tree lined streets which have a charm reminiscent of the south. The tree dense neighborhoods are home to families of squirrels which can be seen scurrying about, chasing one another and eating acorns at all times of the day.  They very well may be a nuisance to the residents but Quinn and I were thoroughly entertained by them everyday.  They also still do milk deliveries in this neighborhood which I thought was a thing of the Norman Rockwell past.  We loved walking the streets of Boise's North End.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://wagabonds.family/content/images/2019/09/44QGPInOTzOSOs0-QExcfg_thumb_2ec9.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="A Bender to Boise"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://wagabonds.family/content/images/2019/09/rI-ZID1-RVGRHjajFpk2JQ_thumb_2f39.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="A Bender to Boise"><figcaption>Milk delivered to your doorstep</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>The main recreational area here is Camelback park.  A sprawling green belt backed up to a hill scape that looks like a camel's hump.  The park has enormous stone steps which takes you to the top of the hill where you can see breathtaking views of downtown.  The back end of the park is filled with miles of trails.  This park was wonderful and served as my gym for our two week stay.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://wagabonds.family/content/images/2019/09/le-sAsAcTCeqfPsUoB2pWg_thumb_2e1e.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="A Bender to Boise"><figcaption>Top of the stairs overlooking Camelback Park</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://wagabonds.family/content/images/2019/09/9-dl7kIlS7WPMlED2w5EXg_thumb_2eca.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="A Bender to Boise"><figcaption>Top ridge of Camelback Park overlooking downtown Boise</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>The downtown area of North End is known as Hyde Park and was perfect walking distance from our place.  There were some pretty wonderful places to eat and shop in Hyde Park.  We loved  <a href="http://www.ggwillikers.com/">G.

You guessed it, "they weren't really that good", surprise!!</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://wagabonds.family/content/images/2019/09/vvF3RmYlSwy6zfnz8GVBIA_thumb_2f13.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="A Bender to Boise"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://wagabonds.family/content/images/2019/09/oPbHp2hSQyugXvsagukYgg_thumb_2f10.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="A Bender to Boise"><figcaption>Steak Fingers from Westside Drive In</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>If you find yourself in downtown Boise be sure to take a stroll down Freak Alley, a block of the downtown area filled with street art from local artists.  It is the largest outdoor mural gallery in the Northwest.  It's very cool and we found ourselves drawn to it more than once. </p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://wagabonds.family/content/images/2019/09/UNADJUSTEDNONRAW_thumb_2ec1.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="A Bender to Boise"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://wagabonds.family/content/images/2019/09/nrjpvlyaRYWsKtcMOSQiYQ_thumb_2df5.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="A Bender to Boise"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://wagabonds.family/content/images/2019/09/b3I274zcRJelgSsu81ENDg_thumb_2deb.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="A Bender to Boise"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>Homeschooling started for us the week we arrived in Boise so we decided to visit some educational spots.  We loved the <a href="http://www.idaho.gov/">Boise State Capital</a> building.  The employees were super friendly and gave Quinn and I a tour of the main vault in the State Treasury office.

It's booming right now and is apparently the fastest growing city in America at the moment.  I have a feeling this city is going to go through some major changes over the next 10 years as people continue to migrate here.  Like Portland, the Boise natives are not too fond of the Californians since they seem to be the fastest growing population of people taking over their city.  So if you're from California you may have some fitting in to do.  Start with being way nicer than your typical Californian, say hi to people as they pass by and engage in chit chat (but avoid letting them know where you are from right away).</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[I'm Going To Tell You All About Portland]]></title><description><![CDATA[I love Portland because it's impressive without trying too hard to be impressive.]]></description><link>https://wagabonds.family/all-about-portland/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5d5ee9212d22bc0dd94866bd</guid><category><![CDATA[oregon]]></category><category><![CDATA[portland]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Aimee Wagner]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 30 Aug 2019 22:22:28 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="https://wagabonds.family/content/images/2019/08/fullsizeoutput_3a35.jpeg" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://wagabonds.family/content/images/2019/08/fullsizeoutput_3a35.jpeg" alt="I'm Going To Tell You All About Portland"><p>While trying to figure out what I wanted to focus on first when writing a blog about Portland, I stumbled across this video.  Go ahead and give it a watch before reading on...it's exactly 5 minutes long and very relevant, I promise.</p><!--kg-card-begin: embed--><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x6TztHIm5P4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></figure><!--kg-card-end: embed--><p>Ok ok, I get it.  The same thing has happened in my hometown of Southern California and now it's over priced and over crowded.  It's true, people are migrating in masses to Portland from other cities, but that's because it <em>is</em> pretty awesome.  If you want it to stop, stop being so awesome Portland.  However, the video doesn't lie, the restaurant they reference, Screen Door which is right by our place, truly has that many people waiting in line to get in everyday, weekdays included. </p><p>Have we been pronouncing Couch St., Cowch St. instead of Cooch St.?  Yes, guilty as charged.  But c'mon Portland, why ya gotta call it that?  Luckily, a friend of mine who's a local informed us early on about the correct pronunciation (correct or not, I still don't want to say the word Cooch).  </p><p>Yesterday was the first rainy day here all month and as luck would have it, I watched this video before heading out for the day, saving Quinn and I the embarrassment of using our umbrella.....phew! </p><p>As you can see, there may be a little resistance to folks like us from California being here and bragging about how nice it is.  But it's not just us outsiders who have a tendency to brag about how amazing Portland is, it's the residents as well.  It also may be a little bit of Fred Armisan's fault, with Portlandia.  That being said, let me proceed with telling all of my 10 to 15 readers about how amazing Portland is (calm down Portlanders, we will be out of your space by the end of August).  </p><p>Where do I begin?  If you like coffee, beer, wine, amazing food, cute shops, gorgeous trees, waterfalls, lush green landscapes, and incredible parks, there's a chance you will like it here.  If you don't like any of those things you should probably stop reading right now and go look up a blog on Death Valley (I hear it's gorgeous this time of the year).  </p><p>Let's start with the name.  The name was actually stolen from Portland, Maine.  In fact the city's name was decided by a coin toss. The two founders of the city, Asa Lovejoy and Frances Pettygrove could not agree on a name so they decided to have a coin toss and whoever won would name the city after their own hometown. Frances won. Had Asa won, Portland would now be called Boston.  Let's think about that for a second y'all.  Speaking of y'all, they also stole the slogan, "Keep Portland Weird<em>" </em>from Austin's "Keep Austin Weird<em>" </em>trademark. Fair enough, Portland actually reminds me a lot of Austin (minus the trees).  </p><p>I love Portland because it's impressive without trying too hard to be impressive.  The city is split by the Willamette River which divides the west side of town from the east side and is connected by several very individual bridges.  In fact, none of the bridges bear any resemblance to one another which gives the city a very eclectic flare. </p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://wagabonds.family/content/images/2019/08/6NIs7al9SiKtlyR77FXJ3Q_thumb_2a03.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="I'm Going To Tell You All About Portland"><figcaption>Markum Bridge</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://wagabonds.family/content/images/2019/08/KUDOYd2vQHKbuAVkmkHN5g_thumb_2c8f.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="I'm Going To Tell You All About Portland"><figcaption>Tilikum Crossing which is for pedestrians and bikes only</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://wagabonds.family/content/images/2019/08/SpwlK0VYTHaK0pbOQfVEKQ_thumb_2c6a.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="I'm Going To Tell You All About Portland"><figcaption>Ross Island Bridge</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>There are several cute neighborhoods, all unique and charming in their own way.  I could spend days wandering through all the neighborhoods looking at the quirky architecture of the houses and untamed gardens. Coming from Orange County, CA, where most of the neighborhoods are carbon-copies of one another with little-to-no unique charm and the yards are perfectly groomed and maintained, Portland is 180 degrees opposite (in the most delightful way).  I couldn't be more enamored with it's charisma.  From our Airbnb we can walk pretty much anywhere we need to.  There are coffee shops, fantastic restaurants, markets, breweries, gift shops, and farmers markets all within a 3-5 minute walk.  I have also noticed that there is art painted on the actual street in some neighborhoods.  Many of which are colorful stars or flowers like this one on our street.  Super peaceful to stand on, until a car blasts through of course.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://wagabonds.family/content/images/2019/08/4-Rruky9TkWlkNuwNznpkA_thumb_2a38.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="I'm Going To Tell You All About Portland"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>If you're in Portland you must visit the popular neighborhoods like downtown Pearl District, Nob Hill, Division, Alberta, and the Hawthorne districts, to name a few.  You could eat and shop yourself into an oblivion all day in any one of these areas. But I want to give a shout out to our little neighborhood on the Northeast end of town called Montavilla, which even several locals are unfamiliar with. Montavilla is in the process of being gentrified and you could literally see where the line divides in certain areas. It sits amidst major thoroughfare streets like East Burnside St. and SE 82nd Ave. which makes it easily accessible to anywhere in the city.  The main drag on SE Stark Street is home to the <a href="http://www.montavillamarket.org/">Montavilla Farmers Market</a> and the <a href="https://www.academytheaterpdx.com/">Academy Theatre</a>.  This theatre has become our Tuesday night tradition.  You can't beat the $4 admission and buy one get one free Tuesday nights.  Not to mention the snacks are $2-$3 each and they serve wine, beer and food from surrounding restaurants.  Regal and AMC could take a few pointers from this theater.  Academy is the way all theaters should be. </p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://wagabonds.family/content/images/2019/08/al7FDaETQoe8mBje7gzTmw_thumb_2939.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="I'm Going To Tell You All About Portland"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>Since being here I have visited several coffee shops, including the famous Stumptown but my favorite so far is <a href="http://bipartisancafe.com/">Bipartisan Cafe</a> on SE Stark St. in our hood.  This place serves <a href="https://coavacoffee.com/">Coava</a> coffee, has the best bagel sandwiches, homemade pies and interesting memorabilia featuring presidents, politicians, and clips of major political or historical events.  Every visit is a history lesson for Quinn with him asking me who all of the presidents and politicians on the walls are.  It has couches to lounge on and legos for kids to play with, it's everything I want it to be.

Hood that you can't see anywhere else.  Along the way there are several wineries, fruit, vegetable and flower stands.  The Apple Valley Country Store is a must.  Serving everything and anything berry related included huckleberry and marionberry milkshakes, jams, jellies and the best damn oatmeal chocolate chip cookie ever to hit your mouth.  This is also where I saw a guy wearing a t-shirt that said, "This is what I do, I drink and I know things" so clearly it attracts fantastic folks (shame on me for not getting a photo of this shirt).</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://wagabonds.family/content/images/2019/08/Me5fY-1aRYG7uU2cDy65dQ_thumb_2ab7.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="I'm Going To Tell You All About Portland"><figcaption>View of Mt.

What a cute and quaint little town this is.  Ashland is off of the I-5 approximately 16 miles from the California border.  It's about 5 hours north of San Francisco and 5 hours south of Portland.  This made for great mid-way stop to Portland from Tracy, CA. Ashland's claim to fame is the Oregon Shakespeare Festival.  The festival brings in thousands of tourist each year looking to attend a variety of plays.  Because of this there is actually a great selection of upscale restaurants, shops and galleries to visit in the town which makes Ashland even more appealing.  We only spent 2 nights, 1 and half days in Ashland so we didn't get to see nearly as much of it as I would have liked to.  I could have easily hiked and eaten around this town for another few days.</p><p>Our first evening in Ashland was spent at a delicious little Indian restaurant downtown called Masala.  This was Quinn's first experience with Indian food and while some of it was too spicy for him he enjoyed a lot of it, especially the mango lassi which he gulped down.  Jamie and I on the other hand, we enjoyed every bite of it.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://wagabonds.family/content/images/2019/08/fullsizeoutput_35b4.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt="A Day (and some change) in Ashland, Oregon"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://wagabonds.family/content/images/2019/08/9D59p-waQVe-qHzLW-d3jQ_thumb_2b79.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="A Day (and some change) in Ashland, Oregon"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://wagabonds.family/content/images/2019/08/-P2bynQaRVGjPf---N8ofg_thumb_2b7a.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="A Day (and some change) in Ashland, Oregon"><figcaption>Ginger beer mule with hibiscus flowers</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>After dinner we checked into the Ashland Hills Hotel and Suites.

The community coincidentally decided to have a community garage sale the same weekend which worked out perfectly and provided free advertising.  This was way more successful than we anticipated. We sold so much stuff that we had to ask some buyers if they could pick up items a week after, mainly our dining table, so we had somewhere to eat as we had company coming into town for a couple of days. We also sold a handful of things on Facebook Marketplace. We found that outdoor furniture and kid's toys tend to move pretty quickly there. Between the garage sale and selling online, most of our big items were gone! I wrangled with some sellers remorse after this, but that has since passed.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://wagabonds.family/content/images/2019/08/G-BIQSE6QQKBbPD9VJ15XQ_thumb_275d.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="The Purge & The Plan"><figcaption>The garage sale</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>For the items we decided to keep, (lots of memorabilia, clothes, kitchen items, towels, sheets, living room furniture &amp; beds) my advice is to really contemplate each item &amp; <em>Marie Kondo</em> all of it. Ask yourself if it truly "sparks joy" and then ask that same question again. If it sparks true joy, keep it! In all honesty, we didn't have the time to ask this about every item we wanted to keep, so if there was a reasonable amount of doubt, we kept it.  </p><p>Randomly, a few weeks prior, I had heard about a company called <a href="https://storage.clutter.com/limitedtime">Clutter</a>, a true godsend.  They come, pack everything up, take it away to storage and deliver it to us whenever we need it again! Between the cost of renting a Uhaul (twice), hiring a couple of guys (twice), and all the packing supplies, it worked out to be a little more than what we had originally budgeted for just a storage unit...Hallelujah! Jamie actually called them 3 separate times just to confirm that their services were legit because he thought it was too good to be true.  Assuming we get all of our stuff back in a year in one piece, this company is amazing!  We were also able to have them store Evan's items and have them delivered to his new apartment when he moves in August.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://wagabonds.family/content/images/2019/08/daDo0LFJSBaCr03l8kdMkA_thumb_27da.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="The Purge & The Plan"><figcaption>2 giant Clutter trucks</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://wagabonds.family/content/images/2019/08/hyU1ceqcTAikwjqBCLDHhg_thumb_27d9.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="The Purge & The Plan"><figcaption>Clutter team member working his magic</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://wagabonds.family/content/images/2019/08/gvlTFj3uSxa5y7uCE2JWyg_thumb_27e2.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="The Purge & The Plan"><figcaption>Some of the amazing crew at Clutter</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><h2 id="the-plan">The Plan</h2><p>The very first idea of this whole trip was to take the cost of living in Southern California (our rent and bills) and use it to pay for an Airbnb for a month-at-a-time in cities we loved. We wanted to spend a decent amount of time in each city in order to get a real feel for what it would be like to live there. </p><p>Airbnb provides great discounts for stays of 30 days or more and since Jamie is going to be working, we thought it would be best to not bounce around too much. (Pro Tip: Book an Airbnb for 31+ days and the Occupancy &amp; Tourist Fees drop-off) </p><p>We also wanted to take this opportunity to visit with family that lived in distant cities who we don't get to see often. (Jamie's parents in Texas &amp; Aimee's brother and family in NY) We were hoping to spend the last half of 2019 road-tripping North America and then hop overseas for 6 months. </p><p>Those were the basic guidelines we went into this with. Seemed easy enough right? Once we sat down and actually started planning the route things changed a bit.  </p><h2 id="the-initial-plan">The Initial Plan</h2><ul><li>August: Portland, OR</li><li>September: New York (Upstate and Brooklyn)</li><li>October: Montreal, QC</li><li>November: Austin, TX</li><li>December: Orange County, CA</li></ul><p>We would spend Thanksgiving with Jamie's family in Texas and Christmas back in Orange County our friends and family there.  We got Portland booked, but trying to figure out getting from Portland to New York became the challenge. Since Jamie is working we are trying to limit travel days to the weekends. Also, the thought of having to persevere a road trip of longer than 5-6 hours with a 5-year-old sounded daunting. Honestly, more than 5 hours in a car for me seems daunting as well.  We decided to break the trip up, spend 1-2 weeks in different cities and see more sights along the way.  </p><h2 id="the-current-plan">The Current Plan</h2><ul><li>August: Tracy, CA (3 nights); Ashland, OR (2 nights); Portland, OR</li><li>September: Boise, ID (2 weeks); Salt Lake City, UT (4 nights); Cheyenne, WY (1 night); Mount Rushmore, SD (1 night); Minneapolis, MN (1 week)</li><li>October: Chicago, IL (one week); Cleveland, OH (1 night); Rochester, NY (1 week); Brooklyn, NY (2 weeks); Fredericksburg, VA (3 nights)</li><li>November: Nashville, TN (1 to 2 weeks); Dallas, TX (1 night); Austin/San Antonio, TX (1-2 weeks)</li><li>December: Dana Point, CA</li></ul><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://wagabonds.family/content/images/2019/08/UNADJUSTEDNONRAW_thumb_28f4.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="The Purge & The Plan"><figcaption>Quinn's map to plot all of our destinations</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>September and October we're hopping around quite a bit, but otherwise we are staying for at least a week in each destination.

We tried to convince Evan to postpone college for one year and join us on our travels but he ultimately decided to continue on with college. He's been focused on this path the last couple of years and is ready to get started. We are so proud of him!</p><h3 id="so-this-all-sounds-well-and-good-but-how-do-you-afford-something-like-this">So this all sounds well and good, but how do you afford something like this?</h3><p>Jamie is a software developer and fortunately the tech industry is very accustomed to remote work. Most of his career has been spent as a remote freelancer and is a big reason we've bounced this idea around for so long. If he can do what he does from our house, why couldn't he do it from a different house? He totally could! </p><p>A year and a half ago he took an opportunity at a company in Irvine called <a href="https://kajabi.com">Kajabi</a>. While they have remote employees, we were a little unsure if they were going to be ok with something like this. Luckily he talked with them earlier this year and they were not only ok with it, but encouraging! This is when we knew that our long discussed plans were actually going to happen. <em>This was our green light!</em></p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://wagabonds.family/content/images/2019/08/fullsizeoutput_6e64.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt="Meet the Wagabonds"><figcaption>Kajabi Dev Crew Send-off Lunch</figcaption></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>As for my job, we had always planned that I would take the year off so that I could focus on homeschooling and the family.
